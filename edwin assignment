Yo! I got orange cones in my car that i used to show my little brother how to park you can borrow them if you want! it helps for parallel parking!

And just let me know the easiest way for you, its a two piece job, i need the coding for c++ for two programs; one that works like a basic cash register that has two modules (Or Functions) taking an item's name and its price, then display it and then add all item together and display at the end subtotal (All prices together), total tax and every single item's price with tax on it. 

Then i need to "module-ize" or "Function-ize" my phone contact program, they are both really simple at this point i just need something basic not anything fancy, i already have 3 names and a way of displaying those names but i need to module-ize it more and add another function so i can have at least two to pick from
